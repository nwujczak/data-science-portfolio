1. Analysis of Doctoral Theses in France (Since the 1980s)
This project involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset of all doctoral theses written in France, with a particular focus on co-supervision trends. The study aims to understand patterns in thesis supervision and collaboration within the academic environment over several decades.

2. Compte Professionnel de Formation (CPF) Investment Analysis
This project examines the investments made by various stakeholders (individuals, companies, regions) in the CPF system. The analysis evaluates the impact of these investments on the success rates of different training programs, highlighting key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of training efforts.

3. Exoplanet Classification Using Light Curve Data
This machine learning project focuses on the classification of planets as exoplanets or non-exoplanets, utilizing light curve data. By applying advanced algorithms, the model predicts the likelihood of a celestial body being an exoplanet, contributing to the broader field of space exploration.

4. RAG Application for Twelve Labs Hackathon (U.S.)
This project was developed during a hackathon hosted by Twelve Labs and involved creating a Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. The solution was designed to meet the needs of the audiovisual industry by enabling efficient video embedding and retrieval systems for video content management and search.
